# GrayPockets - Barbarian Free Cities

## Description

This mod causes Barbarian Clans to convert into Free Cities instead of into City-States in Barbarian Clans mode. I recommend using Leugi's Free City Flavour Mod for names.

* Convert Barbarian Clan into a Free City whenever the UI detects one at least 10 points from converting to a City-State
* New Free City has population equal to the current Era
* Increases the Conversion Point requirement by 10 to compensate
* Hides the difference in the UI so that it appears seamless
* Update in-game text accordingly
* Add notification

## Mod Support

* Nere's Better Barbarian Clans mode

## Requirements

* Expansion: Rise and Fall
* Expansion: Gathering Storm
